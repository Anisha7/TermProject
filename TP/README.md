# ALEX KIDD2


# Description
## Alex Kidd is a comic book character that appeared in a lot of video games and arcades in the 1980s. The first was Alex Kidd in Miracle World and more kept coming. However, this era soon died, and development for versions compatible to new technology ceased. Thus, as the tech industry grew, Alex Kidd was no longer playable and other games took its place. None were as good, though, I would add. 

## Alex Kidd2 is a new, improved version of Alex Kidd. With multiplayer features and an addition of exciting board games in the larger game, Alex Kidd2 is going to bring back memories for the older generations and an entertaining web-based game for the younger generations.
